Comments:

Not sure why the game launched with an error because there was a random while True statement on line 380. Why are there single
quotes where it says, "('Apocalyptic Burger, established in the year of 2011, currently owned by', 'Danny', 'and four other 
employees.')." For that matter, why is that in parentheses? 

I like the instructions you offer. Um, when I say I don't want to play Zombie Food Truck Survival, it says, "Understandable..."?.
I'm stuck in the support, defense, attack. It just keeps looping. Your break on line 56 and subsequent ones are only breaking
you out of one loop. Even once I added the need extra break on 63, which did break the loop if I chose support, it asked for
difficulty and then just showed ASCII art and dropped me to a terminal. I see way more code but this was not glued together well.
